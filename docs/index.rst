Welcome to SPLID-devkit's documentation!
===================================

Welcome to the readme for the Satellite Pattern-of-Life Identification dataset (SPLID) development toolkit. 
The development toolkit consists of a set of basic utility functions for data parsing, manipulation, and visualization. The toolkit also includes tutorials to help the participants get started with the challenge problem. The tutorials will guide the participants in reading and understanding the data, parsing and manipulating the data, training and evaluating the baseline ML algorithm, and submitting their ML algorithms to the competition platform. Additionally, baseline machine learning solutions will be provided, which will be coded in Python using readily available packages and aim to lower the barrier of entry to AI techniques in the SSA research community. The toolkit is designed to help participants familiarize themselves with the dataset, methodologies, and evaluation pipeline and facilitate the assessment of more advanced AI solutions.
